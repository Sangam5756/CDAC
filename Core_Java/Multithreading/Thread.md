### **Threads in Java – Extends vs Implements**

#### **1. Extending `Thread`**

* You **extend** the `Thread` class.
* Override the `run()` method with thread logic.
* In `main`, create an object of your class and call `start()`.

**Example:**

```java
class MyThread extends Thread {
    public void run() {
        System.out.println("Thread running via extends");
    }
}

public class TestThread {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MyThread t = new MyThread();
        t.start();  // starts the thread
    }
}
```

---

#### **2. Implementing `Runnable`**

* Implement the `Runnable` interface.
* Override the `run()` method with thread logic.
* **Cannot directly start**, because it’s not a Thread.
* Pass the `Runnable` object to a `Thread` object and call `start()`.

**Example:**

```java
class MyRunnable implements Runnable {
    public void run() {
        System.out.println("Thread running via Runnable");
    }
}

public class TestRunnable {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MyRunnable r = new MyRunnable();
        Thread t = new Thread(r);
        t.start();  // starts the thread
    }
}
```

---

#### **Key Point**

* Both approaches do the **same job**: run a thread.
* Difference:

  * `Thread` class: single inheritance, cannot extend another class.
  * `Runnable` interface: allows multiple inheritance, more flexible.



### **1. `join()` Method**

* Purpose: Make **current thread wait** until the target thread **finishes execution**.
* Similar to **synchronized** in the sense it controls **execution order**, but it doesn’t lock resources—it only **pauses the thread**.

**Example:**

```java
class MyThread extends Thread {
    public void run() {
        System.out.println("Thread started");
        try { Thread.sleep(2000); } catch(Exception e) {}
        System.out.println("Thread finished");
    }
}

public class Demo {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException {
        MyThread t = new MyThread();
        t.start();
        t.join();  // main thread waits until t dies
        System.out.println("Main thread resumes after t completes");
    }
}
```

**Explanation:**

* `main` thread will **wait** for `t` to finish before printing the last line.
* Optional: `t.join(1000)` → waits max 1 second, then continues even if `t` is not finished.

---

### **2. `isAlive()` Method**

* Purpose: Check if a thread is **still running**.
* Returns `true` if thread is **not terminated**, else `false`.

**Example:**

```java
MyThread t = new MyThread();
t.start();

System.out.println("Is thread alive? " + t.isAlive()); // true
t.join();
System.out.println("Is thread alive? " + t.isAlive()); // false
```

**Key Points:**

* `isAlive()` helps to **monitor thread status**.
* `join()` ensures **sequential execution** when needed.

---

💡 **Tip:**

* Think of `join()` as a way to **pause your thread until another thread “dies”**.
* `isAlive()` is like **checking a heartbeat**—is the thread still running?

## **1. Extending `Thread` vs Implementing `Runnable`**

**Extends Thread:**

* Your class becomes a Thread itself.
* Can override `run()` and call `start()` to execute in a new thread.
* Limitation: **cannot extend another class**.

**Example:**

```java
class MyThread extends Thread {
    public void run() {
        System.out.println("Thread running via extends");
    }
}
```

**Implements Runnable:**

* Thread logic is separate from thread object.
* You create a `Thread` object, pass Runnable, and call `start()`.
* Allows multiple inheritance and **reusing the same task logic**.

**Example:**

```java
class MyRunnable implements Runnable {
    public void run() {
        System.out.println("Thread running via Runnable");
    }
}
Thread t = new Thread(new MyRunnable());
t.start();
```

**Key Insight:**

* Runnable is preferred in **real-world applications** for flexibility and separation of concerns.

---

## **2. Thread Lifecycle**

* **New** → Thread object created.
* **Runnable** → `start()` called; waiting for CPU scheduler.
* **Running** → CPU executes `run()`.
* **Waiting/Blocked** → Waiting for resources or `join()`.
* **Terminated** → `run()` finishes.

**Example:**

```java
Thread t = new Thread(() -> System.out.println("Running"));
t.start(); // Runnable → Running → Terminated
```

---

## **3. sleep() vs wait() vs yield()**

| Method      | Pauses thread | Releases lock? | Usage                       |
| ----------- | ------------- | -------------- | --------------------------- |
| `sleep(ms)` | Yes           | No             | Pause thread for fixed time |
| `wait()`    | Yes           | Yes            | Thread waits for `notify()` |
| `yield()`   | Maybe         | No             | Suggests scheduler to pause |

**Example of sleep:**

```java
Thread.sleep(1000); // pauses 1 sec
```

---

## **4. join()**

* Makes current thread **wait for another thread**.
* Optional timeout allows unblocking if thread is slow.

**Example:**

```java
t1.join(); // main waits for t1 to finish
```

---

## **5. Daemon vs User Thread**

* **User thread:** Keeps JVM alive until complete.
* **Daemon thread:** Background thread (e.g., Garbage Collector); JVM exits if only daemon threads remain.

**Example:**

```java
Thread t = new Thread(r);
t.setDaemon(true); // background task
```

---

## **6. Thread Safety & Race Conditions**

**Problem:** Multiple threads updating same variable cause **inconsistent results**.

**Example: Counter**

```java
class Counter {
    private int count = 0;
    public synchronized void increment() { count++; }
}
```

* `synchronized` ensures **one thread at a time** executes critical section.
* Can also use synchronized blocks to lock only part of method.

---

## **7. Deadlock & Starvation**

* **Deadlock:** Two threads wait for each other indefinitely.

```text
Thread A: lock1 → lock2
Thread B: lock2 → lock1
```

* **Starvation:** Low-priority thread never gets CPU due to higher-priority threads.

---

## **8. Thread Memory Layout**

* **Thread object:** Heap.
* **Runnable object:** Heap, shared if reused.
* **Stack memory:** Each thread has its own stack for local variables.
* **Heap memory:** Shared between threads; race conditions occur here if unsynchronized.

---

## **9. Practical Example of Runnable**

* **Download manager:**

  * Single `DownloadTask implements Runnable`.
  * Multiple threads execute the task for different files.
  * Same object reused; separate threads maintain own stack.

---

## **10. Thread Pools vs New Threads**

* Thread pools **reuse threads**; avoid overhead of creating many threads.
* Control maximum threads; useful for server applications or batch jobs.

---

### **Summary**

* **Extends Thread:** Simpler, less flexible.
* **Implements Runnable:** Flexible, reusable, decouples task logic.
* **Synchronization:** Prevent race conditions with `synchronized`, locks.
* **Daemon/User threads:** JVM behavior depends on thread type.
* **join, sleep, yield:** Control execution order & timing.
* **Thread safety & deadlocks:** Always consider shared resource access and priorities.

Perfect! Let’s visualize the **Thread Lifecycle** in Java **briefly and clearly**. I’ll explain each state and transition.

         | (Thread ends)    |
         +------------------+
```

---

### **State Explanation (Brief)**

1. **New:** Thread object created, not yet started.
2. **Runnable:** Thread is ready; waiting for CPU.
3. **Running:** JVM executes `run()`.
4. **Waiting/Blocked:** Thread paused via `sleep()`, `wait()`, or waiting for resource.
5. **Terminated:** `run()` completes; thread cannot restart.

---

💡 **Key Points for Interviews:**

* `start()` moves **New → Runnable**.
* `sleep()/wait()` → moves **Running → Waiting/Blocked**.
* `notify()/interrupt()/timeout` → moves **Waiting → Runnable**.
* `run()` completes → **Terminated**.



Let’s go **deep into `sleep()` and `interrupt()` in Java threads** with clear explanation, examples, and memory behavior.

---

## **1. `sleep()` Method**

### **Purpose**

* Pauses the **current thread** for a specified time (milliseconds or nanoseconds).
* Thread **does not release any locks** while sleeping.
* Used to **delay execution** or simulate wait time.

### **Syntax**

```java
Thread.sleep(milliseconds);
Thread.sleep(milliseconds, nanoseconds);
```

### **Example**

```java
class MyThread extends Thread {
    public void run() {
        try {
            for(int i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
                System.out.println("Count: " + i);
                Thread.sleep(1000); // pause 1 second
            }
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            System.out.println("Thread interrupted!");
        }
    }
}

public class DemoSleep {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MyThread t = new MyThread();
        t.start();
    }
}
```

**Explanation**

* `sleep()` throws `InterruptedException` because **another thread may interrupt it while sleeping**.
* Sleeping **does not free locks** if thread holds any synchronized block.

---

## **2. `interrupt()` Method**

### **Purpose**

* Used to **signal a thread** that it should stop sleeping/waiting.
* Doesn’t forcibly stop the thread, just sets the **interrupted status**.
* Sleeping thread receives `InterruptedException` if interrupted.

### **Example**

```java
class MyThread extends Thread {
    public void run() {
        try {
            System.out.println("Thread going to sleep...");
            Thread.sleep(5000);  // sleep 5 sec
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            System.out.println("Thread was interrupted!");
        }
    }
}

public class DemoInterrupt {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException {
        MyThread t = new MyThread();
        t.start();
        Thread.sleep(2000);  // wait 2 sec
        t.interrupt();        // interrupt sleeping thread
    }
}
```

**Explanation**

* Thread starts sleeping for 5 seconds.
* Main thread interrupts it after 2 seconds.
* Sleeping thread immediately **wakes up** and throws `InterruptedException`.

---

### **Key Points**

| Method        | Action                                     | Lock released? | Exception?                                        |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------ | -------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| `sleep()`     | Pauses current thread for given time       | No             | `InterruptedException`                            |
| `interrupt()` | Signals thread to stop sleeping or waiting | N/A            | Causes `InterruptedException` if sleeping/waiting |

**Interview Tip**

* Use `sleep()` to simulate delays or periodic tasks.
* Use `interrupt()` to **gracefully stop threads** instead of `stop()`.

Absolutely! Let’s break it down **carefully**. `interrupt()` is **one of the key thread control mechanisms** in Java.

---

## **1. Why do we need `interrupt()`?**

* **Threads may be sleeping or waiting** (`sleep()`, `wait()`, `join()`).
* Sometimes, we want to **stop or change the behavior** of a thread **before it naturally finishes**.
* Java **does not allow forcibly killing a thread safely** (methods like `stop()` are unsafe).
* `interrupt()` provides a **safe way to signal a thread** that it should stop what it’s doing.

---

## **2. How it works**

1. When a thread is **sleeping, waiting, or joining**, calling `interrupt()` will:

   * Wake it up immediately.
   * Throw `InterruptedException` in the target thread.
2. If the thread is **running normally**, calling `interrupt()` just sets its **interrupted status** (a flag).

   * The thread can **check this flag** using `Thread.interrupted()` or `isInterrupted()`.

---

## **3. Use Cases / Why we interrupt threads**

1. **Stop a sleeping thread early**

   * Example: Thread sleeping for 10 sec but user cancels the operation.
   * Instead of waiting 10 sec, we can interrupt the thread to stop immediately.

2. **Stop waiting threads**

   * Example: A thread waiting for a resource using `wait()`.
   * Another thread signals it to stop waiting using `interrupt()`.

3. **Graceful thread termination**

   * Instead of forcibly killing the thread, we **signal** it to finish its task.
   * Thread can clean up resources before stopping.

4. **Control thread execution in thread pools**

   * Example: In Executors, long-running tasks can be **interrupted** if no longer needed.

---

### **Example**

```java
class MyThread extends Thread {
    public void run() {
        try {
            System.out.println("Thread going to sleep...");
            Thread.sleep(5000);
            System.out.println("Thread woke up normally");
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            System.out.println("Thread interrupted early!");
        }
    }
}

public class DemoInterrupt {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException {
        MyThread t = new MyThread();
        t.start();
        
        Thread.sleep(2000); // main thread waits 2 sec
        t.interrupt();      // signal the thread to stop sleeping
    }
}
```

**Output:**

```
Thread going to sleep...
Thread interrupted early!
```

---

### **Key Points**

* **Safe alternative** to `stop()`.
* Used to **control thread execution dynamically**.
* Thread should **handle interruption** gracefully, usually by cleaning up resources and exiting.
* Can be combined with `sleep()`, `wait()`, or long-running loops.

---

💡 **Interview Tip:**

> “`interrupt()` is like tapping someone on the shoulder to tell them to stop what they’re doing—they can choose how to respond, instead of pulling them away forcibly.”
Absolutely! Let’s explain **why `interrupt()` is important at enterprise/real-world level**—this is where understanding **thread control and responsiveness** becomes critical.  

---

## **1. Enterprise Use Case: Graceful Thread Termination**

In real applications, threads often perform **long-running tasks**:  

- Processing user requests  
- Handling background jobs (like sending emails, generating reports)  
- Polling services or reading data streams  

**Problem:**  
- If the application shuts down or the task is no longer needed, **we can’t just kill the thread abruptly**—it may:  
  - Leave resources open (database connections, file handles)  
  - Leave inconsistent data  
  - Cause memory leaks or deadlocks  

**Solution:** Use `interrupt()` to **signal the thread to stop** gracefully.  

**Example:** A report generator task:
```java
class ReportTask implements Runnable {
    public void run() {
        while(!Thread.currentThread().isInterrupted()) {
            // generate report in chunks
            processChunk();
        }
        cleanupResources(); // gracefully close files, DB connections
        System.out.println("Task stopped gracefully");
    }
}
```

- Main thread can call `thread.interrupt()` to **stop the task** without killing the JVM.

---

## **2. Handling Timeouts and User Actions**

- In web applications, users may **cancel a request** or **close the browser**.  
- Instead of letting the background thread continue useless work, we **interrupt it**.  
- Saves CPU, memory, and improves system performance.  

**Example:** File download canceled by user:
```java
if(userCancelled) {
    downloadThread.interrupt(); // stop downloading
}
```

---

## **3. Thread Pools and Executor Services**

- Enterprise applications often use **thread pools** to handle thousands of requests.  
- Threads may be **blocked on long tasks**.  
- Instead of waiting indefinitely, the system can **interrupt tasks** after a timeout.  

**Example:** ExecutorService with timeout:
```java
Future<?> future = executor.submit(task);
future.get(5, TimeUnit.SECONDS); // timeout after 5 seconds
future.cancel(true);              // interrupts the task if still running
```

- Ensures **system responsiveness** and prevents bottlenecks.

---

## **4. Monitoring and System Control**

- Enterprise systems need **robust monitoring**.  
- Threads may hang or deadlock; using `interrupt()` allows:  
  - Detecting stuck threads  
  - Triggering recovery mechanisms  
  - Logging issues for debugging  

---

### **Summary: Why `interrupt()` is needed in enterprise-level apps**

| Reason                                 | Benefit                                     |
|---------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Graceful termination                   | Avoid resource leaks & inconsistent state |
| Handle user cancellations / timeouts   | Improve responsiveness & UX               |
| Manage thread pools & long-running tasks | Prevent system bottlenecks                 |
| Monitoring and recovery                | Detect stuck threads & ensure stability   |

💡 **Key Insight:**  
> In enterprise systems, **abruptly killing threads is unsafe**. `interrupt()` is the **standard, safe way** to signal a thread to stop while letting it **clean up and maintain system integrity**.
