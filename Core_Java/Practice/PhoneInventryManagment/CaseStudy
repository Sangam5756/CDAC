Q.1) Write a Java application for Mobile Phone Inventory Management System.

Mobile Phone Details:

Phone_Id (int) (unique, should be generated automatically), ModelName (String), Brand (String), Price (double),
Ratings (int) (scale between 1 to 5) (changed scale for variation), InStock (boolean: True/False)
PhoneType (enum) [SMARTPHONE, FEATURE_PHONE, FOLDABLE] (changed types)

Requirements:
All CRUD operations MUST happen in constant time performance. (Use any suitable collection like HashMap or ConcurrentHashMap)

Implement required parsing/validation methods and custom exceptions:
1.1) Throws an exception if ratings are not between 1 and 5.
1.2) Validates that the ModelName has a length between 2 and 15 characters. (slightly different range)
1.3) Validates that the PhoneType is one of the predefined types.

Implement below functionalities:
2.1) Add a new Mobile record to the collection. (Add at least 5 new records in Collection) (added one more record requirement)
2.2) Display all Mobile details.
2.3) Display all Mobile details sorted by Phone_Id.
2.4) Search the Mobile which is least expensive in the inventory. (changed from most expensive)
2.5) Remove Mobiles that are not in stock.
2.6) Update Mobile price based on ModelName. (changed brand â†’ model for variation)
2.7) Sort Mobile data as per price in ascending order. (changed from descending)
2.8) Exit from application.
