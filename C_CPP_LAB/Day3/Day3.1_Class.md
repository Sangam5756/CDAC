# ðŸš€ C++ Classes & Objects

---

## ðŸ”¹ What is a Class?

* A **class** is a **blueprint** for creating objects.
* It groups **attributes (variables)** and **methods (functions)** together.
* Example:

  ```cpp
  class Car {
  public:             // access specifier
      string brand;   // attribute
      int year;       // attribute

      void drive() {  // method
          cout << "Car is driving\n";
      }
  };
  ```

---

## ðŸ”¹ What is an Object?

* An **object** is an **instance of a class** (like a real-life car from the Car blueprint).
* Example:

  ```cpp
  int main() {
      Car myCar;             // object created
      myCar.brand = "Tesla"; // set attribute
      myCar.year = 2023;

      cout << myCar.brand << " " << myCar.year << endl;
      myCar.drive();         // call method
      return 0;
  }
  ```

âœ… Output:

```
Tesla 2023
Car is driving
```

---

## ðŸ”¹ Access Specifiers

They define **where class members are accessible**.

1. `public` â†’ accessible from anywhere.
2. `private` (default) â†’ accessible only inside the class.
3. `protected` â†’ accessible inside class + derived classes.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Multiple Objects

A single class can create multiple objects:

```cpp
Car car1, car2;
car1.brand = "BMW";
car2.brand = "Audi";
```

Perfect, Sangam! Letâ€™s make your **Constructors in C++** explanation **EAPLI style** (Easy + Applied + Interview + Real project insights).

---

# ðŸš€ Constructors in C++

---

## ðŸ”¹ 1. What is a Constructor?

* A **constructor** is a **special member function** of a class.
* It has the **same name as the class**.
* Automatically called **when an object is created**.
* **Purpose:** Initialize the objectâ€™s attributes with valid values.
* **Restriction:** Constructor **cannot have a return type** (not even `void`).

### Simple Example:

```cpp
class MyClass {
public:
    MyClass() {  // Constructor
        cout << "Hello World from constructor!\n";
    }
};

int main() {
    MyClass obj;  // Constructor called automatically
}
```

âœ… Output:

```
Hello World from constructor!
```

 **You **donâ€™t need to call a constructor explicitly** â€” it runs automatically.

---

## ðŸ”¹ 2. Parameterized Constructor

* Constructors can **take parameters**, just like normal functions.
* Useful for **initializing attributes with custom values** when an object is created.

### Example:

```cpp
class Car {
public:
    string brand;
    string model;
    int year;

    // Constructor with parameters
    Car(string x, string y, int z) {
        brand = x;
        model = y;
        year = z;
    }
};

int main() {
    Car car1("BMW", "X5", 1999);
    Car car2("Ford", "Mustang", 1969);

    cout << car1.brand << " " << car1.model << " " << car1.year << "\n";
    cout << car2.brand << " " << car2.model << " " << car2.year << "\n";
}
```

âœ… Output:

```
BMW X5 1999
Ford Mustang 1969
```

ðŸ’¡ **Tip:** In real projects, parameterized constructors are **used heavily for setting up objects with initial states** (e.g., DB record objects, API requests, configuration objects).

---

## ðŸ”¹ 3. Key Points

1. **Automatic call:** No need to call the constructor explicitly.
2. **No return type allowed:** Not even `void`.
3. **Overloading allowed:** You can create **multiple constructors with different parameters**.
4. **Initialization in real projects:**

   * DB connection objects â†’ constructor sets host, port, credentials.
   * File handler objects â†’ constructor opens the file.
   * GUI widgets â†’ constructor sets size, position, color.

---

## ðŸ”¹ 4. Interview Questions + Answers

**Q1. What is a constructor?**
ðŸ‘‰ Special method automatically called during object creation to initialize attributes.

**Q2. Can constructors have return types?**
ðŸ‘‰ No.

**Q3. Can you overload constructors?**
ðŸ‘‰ Yes, a class can have **multiple constructors** with different parameters.

**Q4. Default vs Parameterized Constructor?**

* **Default constructor:** Takes no arguments.
* **Parameterized constructor:** Takes arguments to initialize attributes.

**Q5. Real project scenario?**
ðŸ‘‰ When you create a `User` object in a banking app:

```cpp
User u("Sangam", "sangam123", 10000); 
```

Here, the constructor sets the user name, password, and initial balance automatically.

---


* Constructor = automatic initializer for objects.
* Parameterized constructor = sets **custom initial state**.
* Overload constructors for flexibility.
* Widely used in **real projects**: DB models, API objects, services, configs.


# âš¡ Interview / Company-level Notes

* Q: Whatâ€™s the difference between a class and an object?
  â†’ Class is blueprint, object is instance.
  â†’ Class = blueprint (definition). Object = instance (real entity).

* Q: Default access specifier in a C++ class?
  â†’ `private`.

* Q: Can a class have multiple constructors?
  â†’ Yes, via **constructor overloading**.

* Q: Why destructors are important?
  â†’ Free resources (files, sockets, DB connections, memory).

* Q: Real-world use?
  â†’ In a banking project, a Customer class has attributes (id, balance) and methods (deposit(), withdraw()). Each customer record is an object.

---

âœ… **Takeaway**:

* Class = definition, Object = instance.
* Use access specifiers wisely (`public` for APIs, `private` for internal details).
* Constructors/Destructors manage **lifecycle** (very important in resource-heavy apps).

Perfect, Sangam ðŸ‘Œ Youâ€™ve nailed the **concept of class methods**. Let me expand this into a **full study + interview prep package** for you â€” like I did yesterday with constructors/destructors.

# ðŸ“˜ C++ Class Methods (Inside & Outside Definitions)

---

## ðŸ”¹ What are Methods?

* **Methods** = functions that belong to a class.
* They define **behavior** of objects.
* Declared in class, and can be defined:

  1. **Inside the class**
  2. **Outside the class using scope resolution `::`**

---

## ðŸ”¹ Example: Method Inside Class

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class MyClass {
public:
    void myMethod() {  // Defined inside class
        cout << "Hello World from inside class!" << endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    MyClass obj;
    obj.myMethod();  // Call method
    return 0;
}
```

âœ… Output:

```
Hello World from inside class!
```

---

## ðŸ”¹ Example: Method Outside Class

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class MyClass {
public:
    void myMethod();   // Declaration only
};

// Definition outside the class
void MyClass::myMethod() {
    cout << "Hello World from outside class!" << endl;
}

int main() {
    MyClass obj;
    obj.myMethod();
    return 0;
}
```

âœ… Output:

```
Hello World from outside class!
```

---

## ðŸ”¹ Why Two Ways?

* **Inside class definition** â†’ function is treated as `inline` (compiler *may* inline it).
* **Outside class definition** â†’ better for large functions (keeps class definition clean).

---

# ðŸŽ¯ Interview Q\&A (with Answers)

---

**Q1. What is the difference between defining a method inside vs outside a class?**
âœ… Inside â†’ implicitly `inline`.
âœ… Outside â†’ normal function (unless explicitly declared inline).

---

**Q2. Can we overload class methods?**
âœ… Yes, you can define multiple methods with the same name but different parameter lists (method overloading).
Example:

```cpp
class Demo {
public:
    void show(int x) { cout << "x: " << x << endl; }
    void show(double y) { cout << "y: " << y << endl; }
};
```

---

**Q3. Can we define a method both inside and outside at the same time?**
âœ… No. You must choose one place for the definition.
You can only **declare inside** and **define outside** (not both definitions).

---

**Q4. Why is `::` operator needed for outside definition?**
âœ… Because the compiler needs to know that the function belongs to that class.
Otherwise, it would think itâ€™s a normal global function.

---

**Q5. Can static methods exist in C++ classes?**
âœ… Yes. A `static` method belongs to the **class, not an object**. It can be called without creating an object.

Example:

```cpp
class Test {
public:
    static void greet() {
        cout << "Hello from static method!" << endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    Test::greet();  // Called without object
}
```

---

**Q6. Can methods be virtual in C++?**
âœ… Yes. A `virtual` method allows **runtime polymorphism** (decides at runtime which function to call).
Used heavily in **inheritance**.

---

**Q7. Real-world project use case?**

* Inside methods â†’ used for **small utility functions** (e.g., `getId()`, `setName()` etc.).
* Outside methods â†’ used for **big logic implementations** (e.g., DB connection handling, file operations, algorithms).

---

âš¡ **Pro Tip (Interview Trap)**:
If you define a method inside a class, the compiler *suggests* inlining (not guaranteed). If itâ€™s large â†’ it may **increase code size** and reduce efficiency. Thatâ€™s why in industry we keep **declarations in header (.h) files** and definitions in **.cpp files** (clean separation).
