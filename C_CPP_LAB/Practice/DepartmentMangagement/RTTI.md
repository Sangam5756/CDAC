### 🔍 What’s happening

```cpp
Department* dept[3];
Department* hr = new HRDepartment();
Department* fd = new FinanceDepartment();

dept[0] = hr;
dept[1] = fd;
```

Here:

* `dept` is an array of **base class pointers** (`Department*`).
* At runtime, `dept[0]` really points to an `HRDepartment` object.
* But at **compile time**, the compiler only sees the declared type: `Department*`.
  That means:

  * You can only call methods declared in `Department`.
  * So `dept[0]->conductInterviews();` won’t compile — the base class doesn’t know that method exists.

### ✅ Why `dynamic_cast` works

```cpp
auto p = dynamic_cast<HRDepartment*>(dept[0]);
p->conductInterviews();
```

- `dynamic_cast` checks at **runtime** if the object that `dept[0]` points to is really an `HRDepartment`.
- If yes → the cast succeeds, and you get a valid pointer to `HRDepartment`.
- If no → the cast returns `nullptr` (safe failure).

So now `p` is really an `HRDepartment*`, and the compiler lets you call `conductInterviews()`.

---

### 🚩 Without `dynamic_cast`

If you had used a plain `static_cast`:

```cpp
auto p = static_cast<HRDepartment*>(dept[1]); // actually a FinanceDepartment!
p->conductInterviews(); // ❌ undefined behavior, program crash
```

`static_cast` trusts you blindly, so if you cast to the wrong type, you’re in big trouble. That’s why **dynamic_cast is safer** for downcasting.

### 🎭 Tricky Interview Questions around this

1. **Why can’t we just call `dept[0]->conductInterviews()` directly?**
   👉 Because the static type is `Department*`. The compiler enforces that only base-class methods are accessible.

2. **What’s the difference between `static_cast` and `dynamic_cast` here?**

   - `static_cast` does compile-time conversion, no type check. Dangerous if wrong.
   - `dynamic_cast` uses RTTI (Run-Time Type Information) to check actual object type. Safe, but slightly slower.

3. **When should you avoid downcasting?**
   👉 If you can redesign with **virtual functions in the base class**, you don’t need downcasting.
   For example:

   ```cpp
   class Department {
       virtual void specialAction() = 0; // pure virtual
   };

   class HRDepartment : public Department {
       void specialAction() override { conductInterviews(); }
   };
   ```

   Then you can just call `dept[i]->specialAction()` polymorphically, no downcast needed.

4. **Why doesn’t Java need `dynamic_cast`?**
   👉 Java references always carry type info, and you can just do `if (obj instanceof HRDepartment)`. The JVM does the runtime check automatically.

---

### 🔑 Takeaway

- Use **virtual functions** if the behavior is common across departments → clean polymorphism.
- Use **dynamic_cast** only when you really need class-specific behavior that doesn’t belong in the base class.
- Always check if the cast succeeded:

  ```cpp
  if (auto p = dynamic_cast<HRDepartment*>(dept[0])) {
      p->conductInterviews();
  }
  ```
